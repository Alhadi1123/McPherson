# McPherson Strut Simulation and Modeling  

This repository contains the MATLAB code, simulation results, and animations for the McPherson strut suspension system. The project models a quarter-car suspension system, deriving its kinematics and dynamics, and simulating its response to different road profiles.  

## Overview  

Suspension systems are critical in vehicle dynamics, affecting ride comfort, handling stability, and safety. The **McPherson strut** is one of the most commonly used suspension systems due to its simplicity, compact design, and cost-effectiveness.  

This project:  
- Models the McPherson strut suspension using **Lagrangian dynamics**.  
- Uses the **Runge-Kutta 4th order** method for numerical simulation.  
- Simulates the system's response to various input signals.  
- Generates **animated visualizations** of the suspension behavior.  

## Features  
âœ” **Mathematical Modeling**: Derivation of equations of motion using Hamiltonâ€™s Principle and Lagrangian dynamics.  
âœ” **MATLAB Implementation**: Numerical solving of equations and visualization.  
âœ” **Animation**: A MATLAB-based **semi-car** animation to demonstrate system behavior.  
âœ” **Simulation Results**: Analysis of system response to road bumps and ramps.
